# Front-end Developer's Portfolio

This app serves as my personal website. It's made up of two parts: a front-end and a REST API. The front end is built using the Next.js framework, while the REST API is built using the NestJS framework. My portfolio website provides detailed information about me, my skills and experience. You can explore my portfolio, which includes a variety of projects that I have worked on. Additionally, you can find my contact information, which will enable you to get in touch with me easily.

[You can find my portfolio here](https://ok-dev.pp.ua/)
